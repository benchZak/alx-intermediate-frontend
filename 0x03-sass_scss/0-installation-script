Objective: install and set up SASS

Instructions:

Inside the alx-intermediate-frontend repository, create a new directory called 0x03-sass_scss

Linux installation (Optional)
In your ubuntu terminal install node version 20.16 as follows:
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
Exit the terminal using the exit command then reopen it.
Installation Anywhere (Optional)
Install SASS by using the following command if you have node installed:
npm install sass -v 3.7.4

❗️Problem
You're trying to install:
```bash
npm install -g sass@3.7.4
```
But SASS version 3.7.4 does not exist in the npm registry.

That version refers to the Ruby Sass, which is now deprecated. The official and current maintained version is Dart Sass, distributed on npm under the sass package — and its versions start from around 1.x, not 3.x.

✅ Fix
You should install a valid version of Dart Sass. You can use the earliest available version if you want something older — e.g., 1.32.0.

Let’s use sass@1.32.0 for compatibility with older setups.
